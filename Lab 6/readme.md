Lab 6

Live demo: http://citrus7.github.io/CS4802-BioVisualization/Lab%206/

For this lab I started with the sample code and filled in the missing todo functions.  In the settings of the force directed layout, and tweaked the settings until I got readable results that did not explode but still had nodes a decent, readable distance apart.  My generated graph is similar to the example except for some orientation differences.  The clusters on my graph fan out rather than evenly space themselves to form a circle, and are also located closer to the cener of the cluster.
