# CS4802-BioVisualization
#####CS4802 Assignments

This repository contains my work for my Biovisualiztion class.  Each project demonstrates a graphical method of visualizing sets of data related to biology.  Nearly all work was done using HTML5, Javascript, and the D3 library.  The more interesting representations that I created for this class are:

#####Assignment 1 - Conway's Game of life

#####Assignment 2 - Simple Tree Visualization with D3
http://citrus7.github.io/CS4802-BioVisualization/Assignment%202/

#####Assigngment 3 - Parallel Coordinates Chart with D3
http://citrus7.github.io/CS4802-BioVisualization/Assignment%203/

#####Assignment 4 - Gene Sequencing Algorithm + visualization
http://citrus7.github.io/CS4802-BioVisualization/Assignment%204/

#####Lab 6 - Force Directed Graph
