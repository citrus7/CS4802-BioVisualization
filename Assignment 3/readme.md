For this assignment I used the breast cancer data reccomended in the course site.  
I first wrote a python script to convert the data to csv format.  I then used the tutorials on this site to create a parallel coordinates chart of the data.  The benign data sets are colored green and the malignant ones are colored red.

In the future I would like to try the bundling feature to make properties that affect breast cancer more apparent.  I would also like to try some other graphs to see if any can better visually demonstrate the properties that determine a benign or malignant state.
